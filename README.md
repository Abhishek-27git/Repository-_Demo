# Project Define.
First project : RBAC- Node.js <br>
In my first ever project,i learned about the basic structure of backend,how an actual backend server works.Gained hand-on experiences with user authentication,hashing password for better protection by using bcrypt,how connection is built between the backend server and database using url,protecting routes using middleware and implemented several other important feature's as well,that has huge role in web application.

Second Project : Contact-Manager (React) <br>
While working on this project,I developed the better understanding about the react component's,connections between the components,using react routes for navigation between the component's , how a mockup server(JSON SERVER) is used for small frontend project,how to handle api calls effectively,getting used to local storage etc.
